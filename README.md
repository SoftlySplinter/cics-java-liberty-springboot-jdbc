# cics-java-liberty-springboot-jdbc

This project demonstrates a Spring Boot JDBC application integrated with IBM CICS that can be deployed to a CICS Liberty JVM server. The application makes use of the employee sample table supplied with Db2 for z/OS. The application allows you to add, update, delete or display employee information from the table EMP.

Prerequisites

    CICS TS V5.3 or later
    A configured Liberty JVM server
    Java SE 1.8 or later on the z/OS system
    Java SE 1.8 or later on the workstation
    Either Gradle or Apache Maven on the workstation
    IBM Db2 V11 or later on z/OS
 
Building

You can choose to build the project using Gradle or Maven. The project includes both Gradle and Maven wrappers, these wrappers will automatically download required components from your chosen build tool; if not already present on your workstation.

You can also build the sample project through plug-in tooling of your chosen IDE. Both Gradle buildship and Maven m2e will integrate with Eclipse's "Run As..." capability allowing you to specify the required build-tasks. There are typically clean bootWar for Gradle and clean package for Maven, as reflected in the command line approach shown later.

Note: When building a WAR file for deployment to Liberty it is good practice to exclude Tomcat from the final runtime artifact. We demonstrate this in the pom.xml with the provided scope, and in build.gradle with the providedRuntime() dependency.

Note: If you import the project to an IDE of your choice, you might experience local project compile errors. To resolve these errors you should refresh your IDEs configuration. For example, in Eclipse: for Gradle, right-click on "Project", select "Gradle -> Refresh Gradle Project", or for Maven, right-click on "Project", select "Maven -> Update Project...".
Gradle

Run the following in a local command prompt:

On Linux or Mac:

./gradlew clean bootWar

On Windows:

gradlew.bat clean bootWar

This creates a WAR file inside the build/libs directory.
Maven

Run the following in a local command prompt:

On Linux or Mac:

./mvnw clean package

On Windows:

mvnw.cmd clean package

This creates a WAR file inside the target directory.

Deploying

    Ensure you have the following features in server.xml:
        servlet-3.1 or servlet-4.0
        jsp-2.3
        springBoot-2.0
        jdbc-4.0


    Note: servlet-4.0 will only work for CICS TS V5.5 or later

    Add a datasource definition to your server.xml. this sample uses two (almost identical) data source definitions in order to demonstrate two different methods of identifying the datasource to be used by the application.
    E.g. as follows:

     <dataSource id="t4a" jndiName="jdbc/jdbcDataSource" type="javax.sql.DataSource">
        <jdbcDriver>
            <library name="DB2LIB">
                <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/classes" includes="db2jcc4.jar db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar"/>
                <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/lib"/>
            </library>
        </jdbcDriver>
        <properties.db2.jcc currentSchema="DSN81110" databaseName="DSNV11P2" driverType="4"
	     password="<your password>" portNumber="41100" serverName="<your server name>" user="<your userid>"/>
        </dataSource>
        
        <dataSource id="t4b" jndiName="jdbc/jdbcDataSource-bean" type="javax.sql.DataSource">
        <jdbcDriver>
            <library name="DB2LIB">
                <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/classes" includes="db2jcc4.jar db2jcc_license_cisuz.jar"/>
                <fileset dir="/usr/lpp/db2v11/jdbc/lib"/>
            </library>
        </jdbcDriver>
        <properties.db2.jcc currentSchema="DSN81110" databaseName="DSNV11P2" driverType="4" 
	     password="<your password>" portNumber="41100" serverName="<your server name>" user="<your userid>"/>
    </dataSource>  

    Both type 4 datasource connections above are the same except for the jndiName. 
    The jndiName defined in datasource t4a is referenced by the application.properties file in the resources directory of the application.
    The jndiName defined in datasource t4b is referenced by an @Bean annotated dataSource() method in the application.

	 



    Copy and paste the WAR from your target or build/libs directory into a CICS bundle project and create a new WARbundlepart for that WAR file.

    Deploy the CICS bundle project as normal. For example in Eclipse, select "Export Bundle Project to z/OS UNIX File System".

    Alternatively, manually upload the WAR file to zFS and add an <application> configuration to server.xml:

    For example:
       <application id="empJDBCapp" location="/u/fitzget/war files/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jdbc-0.1.0.war" type="spring"/>


Trying out the sample

    Find the base URL for the application in the Liberty messages.log e.g. http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jdbc-0.1.0.

    Paste the base URL along with the REST service suffix 'allRows' into the browser e.g. http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/allRows
    The browser will prompt for basic authentication. Enter a valid userid and password - according to the configured registry for your target Liberty JVM server.

    All the rows in table EMP should be returned.

    The allRows request calls a method in the application which uses the application.properties file to determine which datasource definition to use. If you make the same request to REST service allRows2 then the application uses the @Bean annotated dataSource method to determine the correct dataSource. The @Bean method will use the jndiName used in dataSource t4b whereas the application.properties file will used the jndiName specified in t4a.
    
Summary of all available interfaces     

http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/allRows
    All rows in table EMP will be returned - the datasource is obtained from the application.properties file
    
http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/allRows2
    All rows in table EMP will be returned - the datasource is obtained from an @Bean method
    
http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/addEmployee/{firstName}/{lastName}
    A new employee record will be created using the forst name and last name supplied. All other fields in
    the table will be set by the application to the same values by this demo application.
    If sucessfull the employee number created will be returned.
    
http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/oneEmployee/{empno}
    A single employee record will be displayed if it exists.
    
http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/updateEmployee/{empNo}/{newSalary}
    The employee record will be updated with the salary amount specified.
    
http://myzos.mycompany.com:httpPort/com.ibm.cicsdev.springboot.jms-0.1.0/deleteEmployee/{empNo}
    The employee record with the empNo specified will be deleted if it exists


{firstName} and {lastName} should be replaced by by names of your choosing.
	the definiton of FIRSTNME in table EMP is VARCHAR(12)
	the defintion of LASTNAME in table EMP is VARCHAR(15)
{empno} whould be replaced by a 6 character employee number. 
	the defintion of EMPNO in the EMP table is char(6)
{newSalary} should be replaced by a numeric amount 
	the defintion of SALARY in the EMP table is DECIMAL(9, 2)
